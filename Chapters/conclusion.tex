Massive usage of Cloud computing, it is important that not only provide services without any delay which are implemented on a cloud but also produce the effective resource utilization method for all the resources which are used by that services. We proposed a Bi-Directional LSTM model to predict resource usage on a BitBrain cloud dataset. the proposed model more effective to predict resource usage like CPU, memory, network on VM machines. We also perform classical time series models like ARIMA and VAR to understand the performance produced by those model. And compare with a different variants of the LSTM and Bi-LSTM model. There are some very interesting implementations and application of the proposed model in the field of cloud environments which helps to improve the strategy of resource allocation on a cloud.
